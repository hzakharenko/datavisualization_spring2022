        <h1>An evolving music taste: </h1>
        <h2> How the coronavirus pandemic changed the way people listen to music</h2>
    </div>
    <h3>by Hanna Zakharenko</h3>
    <p>
        Art is a reflection of what is going on in the world. Historically, 
        music taste and the song content have been shaped by important events. 
        In 1985,<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/624770/live-aid-concert-history" target="_blank">
        the Live Aid charity concert</a> reached 1.9 billion people around 
        the world to help raise money for Ethiopian famine relief. Alongside big
        events to support causes, songs have been written about major 
        conflicts. John Lennon wrote “Imagine” as a wish for world peace.
        “Respect” by Aretha Franklin was a powerful anthem for both civil 
        rights and feminist movements. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The relationship between music and conflict has long been explored in 
        history, especially around global events and war. 
        In <a href="https://doi.org/10.5406/ethnomusicology.55.1.0112" target="_blank">
        “Music in War, Music for Peace: A Review Article,”</a> from the 
        ethnomusicology journal, John Morgan O’Connell performed a colloquium
        where he found that: “musicians employed music to communicate multiple 
        interpretations of a peaceful solution, using musical performance as a 
        medium for addressing the diverse aspirations of distinctive audiences. 
        In this respect, a peaceful song for one person could be a warlike song for another.”

        Although it has been only two years since the coronavirus outbreak was 
        declared a pandemic, music taste has already begun to shift. Some of 
        these occurrences are likely just a growing change that has been 
        happening as music taste and the way we listen to music (i.e. streaming,
        playing records, buying CDs, etc.) develops over time. Others may be a 
        direct reflection of what is happening in the world. Regardless, it is
        compelling to look at these data side by side and see how they might 
        already play a role together. This visual story explores that relationship.

        Looking forward, it will be interesting to see how music changes into
        the 2020s, and if the changes to the music industry we’ve seen so far
        throughout the pandemic are permanent, or merely a reflection of 
        emotions during the pandemic.
